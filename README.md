This pandas script in Jupyter Notebook tries to analyze the disctrict wide school standardized test results. 
I have aggregated the school data I obtained and have analyzed the following
trends:
1) High level district wise snapshot of the school metrics
2) Summary of metrics for each school
3) Top perfoming schools by % overall passing
4) Bottom performing schools by % overall passing
5) Scores by school spending
6) Scores by school size
7) Scores by school type

Thank you
